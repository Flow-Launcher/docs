### Support

Flow Launcher is an open source project that is updated and maintained by a team of volunteers. If you have any issues or questions, the Flow Launcher team and other users can help in the following ways:

- For any errors or bug reports raise an issue in the GitHib Repository. Please follow the new issue template and try and describe in as much detail as you can what you were doing when the error occurred. If it is determined the error is with a third party plugin, you may be directed to open the issue in the plugin author's repository so they can investigate.
